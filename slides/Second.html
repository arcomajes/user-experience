                User Experience (UX) refers to the overall interaction a user has with a product, 
                service, or system. It focuses on usability, accessibility, and satisfaction 
                to enhance user engagement and efficiency.

                User Interface (UI) is the visual and interactive elements of a software application or website 
                that users interact with. It includes components like buttons, menus, text fields, images, 
                and layouts that facilitate user interaction. A well-designed UI enhances usability, making it 
                easier for users to navigate and complete tasks efficiently.
